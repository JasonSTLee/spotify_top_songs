# ðŸŽ¼ Spotify Top Songs

Spotify's annual "Wrapped" feature showcases users' top songs, albums, and artists based on their listening data. However, many users â€” myself included â€” often find that these "top songs" don't truly reflect how we feel about our favorite songs. To tackle this, I've created a **project that explores alternative ways to define 'top songs'**. By creating different metrics like listening streaks, replay frequency, completion rates and more; this project offers multiple perspectives on your most-played tracks.

To get the data from your Spotify account (works with premium and free accounts) click the link [here](https://www.spotify.com/uk/account/privacy/). After up to 5 business days Spotify will email you a zip file of jsons containting streaming history, payment information, search queries and more. 

Getting my user data required using Spotify's api with the Spotify wrapper. The Jupyter notebook has outlined ways to use the Spotipy wrapper to retrieve user track data, and turning the Spotify json files to csv then importing to Postgresql for further analysis. 

**Tech used:** Python (libraries include Pandas, Spotipy, Spotify), Postgresql, Tableau

## Metric 1) Most Minutes Listened

Adding up total minutes per track.

This metric adds the total minutes listened to per song.

      <strong>Cons</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Bias toward longer songs</li>
        <li>Skewed by passive listening</li>

      <strong>Cons</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Can be skewed towards songs with bouts of high listening frequency</li>
        <li>Assumes consistent interest since date added</li>

## Metric 7) Lowest Avg Days Between Listens

<img width="686" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-18 at 2 16 01 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb04ae8a-c617-4760-8c7c-73aaf694db4b" />

    <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 50%; padding: 10px;">
      <strong>Pros</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Identifies songs that are listened to frequently over time</li>

This metric averages the percentage of how thorough a song is played, accounting for short and full listens. Not to be confused with Metric 6) Highest Average Percentage Listened - that accounts for a song's appearance rather than the song's length.

<table>

    <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 50%; padding: 10px;">
      <strong>Pros</strong>
      <ul>

      <strong>Cons</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Longer songs or songs with longer intro and outros could be penalized</li>
        <li>Focuses not on how often a song is played but how frequently it is completed</li>

      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

# Conclusion

What I learned the most was that a simple business metric such as 'Top Songs' can be defined in many ways depending on the user / business goal. Each definition - whether average duration listened, most minutes listened to per day since added, etc - offers a unique lens through which to interpret listening behavior. By diving deeper and augmenting what it means to be a top song, we're able to view different results. Some metrics have overlapping top songs, reinforcing trends and patterns while other metrics show different insights. 

Ultimately there are no absolute right and wrongs. This project was to explore seamingly straight forward data and create different branches of a north star metric.
